#Scio C# Training#
## Exercises

In this repository you will find a series of exercises proposed in order to train the developers on Scio in C# in particular and in different .NET tools in general (NUnit, Moq, Autofac, CastleWinsord, etc).

### Important
Some projects ***do not compile*** and/or only contains the unit tests, the idea is that the developers fork the repository, then they will **fix** and/or **implement** the changes.
